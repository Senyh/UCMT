**U**ncertainty-guided **C**ollaborative **M**ean-**T**eacher (UCMT)

## Usage

### 0. Requirements
The code is developed using Python 3.7 with PyTorch 1.11.0. 
All experiments in our paper were conducted on a single NVIDIA Quadro RTX 6000 with 24G GPU memory.

Install from the ```requirements.txt``` using:
```angular2html
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 1. Data Preparation
#### 1.1. Download data
The original data can be downloaded in following links:
* ISIC Dataset - [Link (Original)](https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data/#2018)

#### 1.2. Split Dataset
The ISIC dataset includes 2594 dermoscopy images and corresponding annotations. 
Split the dataset, resulting in 1815 images for training and 779 images for testing.
```angular2html
python data/split_dataset.py
```
Then, the dataset is arranged in the following format:
```
DATA/
|-- ISIC
|   |-- TrainDataset
|   |   |-- images
|   |   |-- masks
|   |-- TestDataset
|   |   |-- images
|   |   |-- masks
```

### 2. Training
#### 2.1 Adopting DeepLabv3Plus as backbone:
```angular2html
python train.py --backbone DeepLabv3p
```
#### 2.2 Adopting U-Net as backbone:
```angular2html
python train.py --backbone UNet
```

### 3. Evaluation
```angular2html
python eval.py
```

### 4. Visualization
```angular2html
python visualization.py
```
